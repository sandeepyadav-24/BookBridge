# Book Bridge - JIIT College

Welcome to Book Bridge, the platform for students at JIIT College to lend and borrow books among each other. Our goal is to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and resources within the college community.

## How It Works

1. **Browse Books**: Explore the available books in our collection. You can search for specific titles, authors, or genres to find what you're looking for.

2. **Request a Book**: Found a book you want to borrow? Click on the book title to view more details and check its availability. If the book is available, you can request to borrow it.

3. **Lend Your Books**: Have books you're willing to share with fellow students? Add them to our collection by filling out a simple form with book details.

4. **Arrange Pickup/Delivery**: Once a book request is approved, arrange a convenient pickup/delivery location and time with the lender.

5. **Return Borrowed Books**: Enjoyed the book? Return it to the lender by the agreed-upon date. Help keep the Book Bridge community thriving by returning books on time and in good condition.

## Guidelines

- **Respect Ownership**: Treat borrowed books with care and return them in the same condition as you received them.
- **Communicate**: Keep in touch with the lender throughout the borrowing process to coordinate pickup, return, or any changes in plans.
- **Honor Commitments**: Stick to agreed-upon pickup/delivery and return dates. If you need to extend your borrowing period, communicate with the lender as soon as possible.
